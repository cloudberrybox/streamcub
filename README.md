XBMC add-on for Streamcub streaming service

## What is Streamcub?

Streamcub is a online bit-torrent cloud storage service and allows users to stream video directly into a web browser, your media box or to a VLC client. The service is fast and secure and does not have any storage limitations. You can add as many torrents as you like to your account and you only pay for the bandwidth you use when streaming.

## Motivation

We are a bunch of movie freaks who got tiered of the way we enjoy movies and TV shows today. Not to mention the hassling and waiting of downloading torrents and finding the right subtitles all the time instead of just having it all on-demand. That's why we started our own project and developed our own Cloudberry media box based on the best open source media center on the Internet, XBMC. We developed this add-on to bring the world of torrent streaming to our living room.
